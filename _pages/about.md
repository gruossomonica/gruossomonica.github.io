Hi everyone! I'm Monica, a Software Engineer based in Milan, Italy.

I was born in Potenza, Italy, on April 24, 1992. I graduated with honors in Computer Engineering from the University of Basilicata in July 2018.

That same year, I joined the [Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics](https://dimie.unibas.it/site/home.html), (DiMIE) at the [University of Basilicata](https://portale.unibas.it/site/home.html), where I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science. My thesis, titled _"Human Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"_, and the Ph.D. course were supervised by [Dr. Ugo Erra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugoerra).

I have a passion for programming and continuous learning. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning for image analysis, computer vision, and autonomous driving vehicles.

My professional experience includes research and analysis of the state of the art, requirements gathering, data collection, software design and implementation using both traditional and deep learning techniques. Additionally, I have expertise in testing, debugging, and producing comprehensive documentation., as well as testing, debugging, and documentation production.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, reading (especially crime novels), and watching movies and TV series. I also stay active by cycling and swimming.
