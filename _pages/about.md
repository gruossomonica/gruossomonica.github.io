Hi everyone! I'm Monica, a Software Engineer. My experience concerns research and analysis of the state-of-the-art, requirements and data collection, software design and implementation based on both traditional and deep learning techniques, testing, debugging, and production of documentation.

I was born in Potenza, Italy, on 24/04/1992. I graduated with honors in Computer Engineering at the University of Basilicata, Italy, in July 2018.

In the same year, I joined the DiMIE, [Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics](https://dimie.unibas.it/site/home.html), at the [University of Basilicata](https://portale.unibas.it/site/home.html), Potenza (Italy), where I completed the Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science under the supervision of Dott. Ugo Erra with a thesis entitled _"Human Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"_. 

My main research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and image analysis.

In my free time, I like to cook, read books (especially crime stories), and watch films and TV series. Also, I try to keep fit by cycling and swimming.
